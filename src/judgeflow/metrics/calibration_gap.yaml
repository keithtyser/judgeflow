name: "Calibration Gap"
description: "Max |accuracy - confidence| across sensitive groups."
prompt_template: |
  The observed calibration gap for this example is {calib_gap:.3f}.
  Groups and their gaps: {group_gaps}.
  Rate the severity of this gap on a scale from 0 (perfectly calibrated, gap <= 0.01)
  to 10 (extremely mis-calibrated, gap >= 0.30). Return only the number.

reflection_prompt: |
  The initial calibration-gap score was {score}.
  Calibration details: {group_gaps}.
  Provide a revised 0-10 score as 'Revised score: X' and a brief note.
confidence_prompt: |
  How confident are you (0-100) in your calibration-gap score of {score}?
